.SH NAME
.printf.c.
- A re-creation of the printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS

To use this function the holberton.h header file containing the various prototypes was created is needed.

a format.c file containing the functions for the conversion specifiers was also created.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a format which is described
below. This function write its output to the stdout, the standard output stream

.SH prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directive.
while ...refers to a list of variadic variables of any type.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

The arguments used are handled by conversion specifiers as listed below:

.IT
.B c
- The integer or char argument converts to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written. The conversion specifier %c is used. 

.IT
.B s
- The argument shall be a literal string. No special provisions are made for multibyte characters.The behavior of printf with the s conversion specifier is undefined if the argument value is not a pointer to a literal string. Characters from the literal string array are written up to, but not including,the terminating null byte ('\0'). the conversion specifier %s is used.

.IT
.B %
- A % character is written and no argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.IT
.B b
- The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.

.IT
.B d, i
- The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.IT
.B p
- The pointer is printed in hexidecimal format preceded by '0x'.

.IT
.B r, R
- 'r' prints string in reverse. 'R' prints encrypted rot13.

.IT

.B o, u, x, X
- The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexidecimal notation (x or X); the letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X conversion.

.IT
.B S
- Prints ascii characters #32 - #127 as they appear in the argument string. All other ascii characters are converted to hexidecimal, then written to \
standard output.

.SH RETURN VALUES
The _printf() function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.
